##	Understanding "basic" statistic concepts

As a statistics major and data science professional, I still struggle with "basic" statistics concepts every day. When I find simpler ways of understanding seemingly complex ideas, I celebrate. Learning statistics should not be as cumbersome as I've experienced. Here's my collection of better ways of understanding statistics.

####	Confidence Intervals

I read this amazing [blog](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2024/04/17/what-does-a-confidence-interval-mean/) that breaks down why statisticans are <u>so</u> particular with the *exact* interpretation of a 90% confidence interval. It details when it's important to be specific about interpreting CIs (when samples are not representative of the population) and when it's okay (perfectly random samples) to loosely describe 90% confidence intervals as "there's a 90% chance the true parameter is within this interval".
