# Books

Take a look at my rarely-updated library 🙂. Disclaimer: these are not all the books I read. In between dense reads, I often enjoy picking up a cheesy romance novel! 

The **5-star rating system** should be taken with a grain of salt! I tend to do a lot of research on books I decide to read, so they end up being great reads. The quotes are my favorite excerpts. The thought bubbles are my thoughts. I starting notating which are unfinished, because we don't need to finish every book we start!
